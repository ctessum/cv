abstract = {Abstract Modeling atmospheric chemistry is computationally expensive and limits the widespread use of chemical transport models. This computational cost arises from solving high-dimensional systems of stiff differential equations. Previous work has demonstrated the promise of machine learning (ML) to accelerate air quality model simulations but has suffered from numerical instability during long-term simulations. This may be because previous ML-based efforts have relied on explicit Euler time integration—which is known to be unstable for stiff systems—and have used neural networks which are prone to overfitting. We hypothesize that parsimonious models combined with modern numerical integration techniques can overcome this limitation. Using a small-scale mechanism to explore the potential of these methods, we have created a machine-learned surrogate by (a) reducing dimensionality using singular value decomposition to create an interpretably-compressed low-dimensional latent space and (b) using Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to create a differential-equation-based representation of the underlying dynamics in the compressed latent space with reduced stiffness. The root mean square error of ML model prediction for ozone concentration over 9 days is 37.8\% of the root mean square concentration across all simulations in our testing data set. The surrogate model is 10× faster with 12× fewer integration timesteps compared to reference model and is numerically stable in all tested simulations. Overall, we find that SINDy can be used to create fast, stable, and accurate surrogates of a simple photochemical mechanism. In future work, we will explore the application of this method to more detailed mechanisms and their use in large-scale simulations.},

abstract = {Air quality models can support pollution mitigation design by simulating policy scenarios and conducting source contribution analyses. The Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP) is a powerful tool for equitable policy design as its variable resolution grid enables intra-urban analysis, the scale of which most environmental justice inquiries are levied. However, InMAP underestimates particulate sulfate and overestimates particulate ammonium formation, errors that limit the model's relevance to city-scale decision-making. To reduce InMAP's biases and increase its relevancy for urban-scale analysis, we calculate and apply scaling factors (SFs) based on observational data and advanced models. We consider both satellite-derived speciated PM2.5 from Washington University and ground-level monitor measurements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, applied with different scaling methodologies. Relative to ground-monitor data, the unscaled InMAP model fails to meet a normalized mean bias performance goal of <±10\% for most of the PM2.5 components it simulates (pSO4: −48\%, pNO3: 8\%, pNH4: 69\%), but with city-specific SFs it achieves the goal benchmarks for every particulate species. Similarly, the normalized mean error performance goal of <35\% is not met with the unscaled InMAP model (pSO4: 53\%, pNO3: 52\%, pNH4: 80\%) but is met with the city-scaling approach (15\%–27\%). The city-specific scaling method also improves the R2 value from 0.11 to 0.59 (ranging across particulate species) to the range of 0.36–0.76. Scaling increases the percent pollution contribution of electric generating units (EGUs) (nationwide 4\%) and non-EGU point sources (nationwide 6\%) and decreases the agriculture sector's contribution (nationwide −6\%).},

@article{Millet2012,
abstract = {We used an ensemble of aircraft measurements with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to constrain present-day North American ethanol sources, and gauge potential long-range impacts of increased ethanol fuel use. We find that current ethanol emissions are underestimated by 50{\%} in Western North America, and overestimated by a factor of 2 in the east. Our best estimate for year-2005 North American ethanol emissions is 670 GgC/y, with 440 GgC/y from the continental U.S. We apply these optimized source estimates to investigate two scenarios for increased ethanol fuel use in the U.S.: one that assumes a complete transition from gasoline to E85 fuel, and one tied to the biofuel requirements of the U.S. Energy Indepence and Security Act (EISA). For both scenarios, increased ethanol emissions lead to higher atmospheric acetaldehyde concentrations (by up to 14{\%} during winter for the All-E85 scenario and 2{\%} for the EISA scenario) and an associated shift in reactive nitrogen partitioning reflected by an increase in the peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) to NO(y) ratio. The largest relative impacts occur during fall, winter, and spring because of large natural emissions of ethanol and other organic compounds during summer. Projected changes in atmospheric PAN reflect a balance between an increased supply of peroxyacetyl radicals from acetaldehyde oxidation, and the lower NO(x) emissions for E85 relative to gasoline vehicles. The net effect is a general PAN increase in fall through spring, and a weak decrease over the U.S. Southeast and the Atlantic Ocean during summer. Predicted NO(x) concentrations decrease in surface air over North America (by as much 5{\%} in the All-E85 scenario). Downwind of North America this effect is counteracted by higher NO(x) export efficiency driven by increased PAN production and transport. From the point of view of NO(x) export from North America, the increased PAN formation associated with E85 fuel use thus acts to offset the associated lower NO(x) emissions.},
